# Analysis of Penalty Shootouts in Football – Collective Scientific Project

This project, conducted as part of the Collective Scientific Project (PSC) at École Polytechnique, offers an in-depth study of penalty shootouts in football. It combines a descriptive statistical approach with more advanced analyses to better understand the factors influencing the success or failure of a penalty shot, from both the shooter's and goalkeeper's perspectives.

## Description

The project is based on data from several international competitions (World Cup, Euro, Champions League, Europa League, Copa America, Coupe de France, Club World Cup, Africa Cup of Nations, Copa Libertadores, and Gold Cup) to build a rich analytical database.  
The **Jupyter Notebook** provided follows the structure of the final report, with section titles corresponding directly to the written document.  
The results and interpretations are automatically exported to a `.txt` file when the notebook is run. The graphs shown in the report are automatically saved as `.png` images when the relevant cells are executed.

## Notebook Contents

The project is structured into several main parts:
- **Descriptive statistics**: shot zone distribution, shooter's foot analysis, goalkeeper behavior, etc.
- **Cross-analysis**: influence of shooter and goalkeeper preferences, comparison between major and minor competitions, etc.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scipy`, etc.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Open `psc_final.ipynb` in a Jupyter environment.
3. Run all cells: the file `output.txt` will be generated automatically with all notebook outputs.

```bash
jupyter notebook psc_final.ipynb
